# MyTasks App - ReactJs Project

Hey There! After some time of working with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript I am finally starting to learn ReactJs.

This is just a basic Tasks / Todo app built with ReactJs. Mostly it is a YouTube Tutorial follow up but I am adding a little bit of styling and 1-2 extra functionality of my own.
